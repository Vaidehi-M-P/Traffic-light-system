# Traffic-light-system
This project uses **Infrared (IR) Sensors** and **Traffic Lights** to simulate a parking system. The system uses IR sensors to detect the presence of vehicles and controls traffic lights accordingly. Additionally, a **buzzer** is triggered if the vehicle exceeds a certain threshold.
